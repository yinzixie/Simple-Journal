Due to the time limitation, we just let users to change their head photo, username and signature in setting page.
Design principle
The design of the application is followed the design principal. It uses low fidelity as a chief source, added some improvement due to the suggestion from other users to make the application meet the useability for users (Tohidi et al. 2006). The main colour is white with different colour of the main menu action.
